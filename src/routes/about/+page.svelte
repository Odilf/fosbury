    <h1> Fosbury </h1>

    <p> You know how in every project, you: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Use a reset (and/or a normalizer) </li>
        <li> Make some CSS variables for theming </li>
        <li> Have some very broad utility classes </li>
    </ul>
    <p> And then you have to copy and paste all of that into every project? </p>

    <p> Well, I got tired of doing that, so I made a library that does it for me. That's pretty much it. </p>
    <p> It is stupid minimal. </p>
